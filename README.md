## Project Background
AtliQ Hardware is an Indian computer hardware and peripheral manufacturer and supplier founded in 2017. It has 3 regions across India. I'm partnering with the Sales Director and regional managers to extract sales insights and deliver recommendations to track sales trends and improve performance across sales, marketing, and customer service departments.

## Data Structure and Initial Checks (ERD)
The company's main database structure consists of 5 tables as shown below.
![ERD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d13cf3af-7e75-445d-98aa-53b2356e4e16)


For the initial checks, SQL queries regarding various business questions are as follows:

1. What was the total number of transactions done?
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM transactions;
   ```
2. How many customers does AtliQ Hardware have?
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM customers;
   ```
3. How many transactions were done in 2020?
   ```sql
   SELECT transactions.*, date.*
   FROM transactions
   INNER JOIN date on transactions.order_date=date.date
   WHERE date.year=2020;
   ```  

## Power Query for Data Inspection and Cleaning
- 4 records from the Transactions table had their sales amounts in USD instead of INR. We created a custom column using Power Query's **M syntax** where all the sales amounts were normalized into INR. At the time of the analysis, 1 USD = 84 INR.
![normalized sales amount](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7cc1a66-e602-41ed-97de-36aad4b4b9af)

- We filtered out 2 records from the Transactions table which had sales amounts of 0 and -1, which didn't make sense.
- AtliQ hardware is operational only in India. The Markets table contained records from New York and Paris. We filtered out these records from the analysis.

### Analysis Report
A dynamic Excel dashboard used to report and explore sales trends is included below.

## Executive Summary
AtliQ Hardware's sales analysis of 150k records across 2017 - 2020 shows a decline in revenue over the years. **2018** was the best-performing year with a revenue contribution of 42%. The **North** region accounts for **69%** of the total revenue, the **Central** region contributes **27%**, while the **South** region is the least-performing, with **4%**. In terms of customers, brick-and-mortar stores account for **76%** of the total revenue. AtliQ Hardware can benefit from allocating more marketing budget to target more E-commerce customers, opening more stores in the South region to target more sales and boost existing sales, and analyzing customer preferences in brick-and-mortar stores, to enhance E-commerce customer performance.

## Recommendations

- Open more stores in the South region to boost existing sales.
- Analyze customer behaviors and preferences in brick-and-mortar stores to enhance customer performance for E-commerce stores.
